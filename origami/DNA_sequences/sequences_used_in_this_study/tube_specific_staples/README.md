## ssDNA overhangs used for Tube assembly

* In addition to the binding strand sequences listed in this folder, the tubes presented in the main article were assembled using dipids with one ssDNA overhang (GATCTCAAGTTTCGTTCATCCGTACTGGCGGGATTA TCCTCCTCCTCCTCCTCCT), oriented towards the interior of the assembled tube. Furthermore, on average, every twentieth dipid had one ssDNA overhang extending towards the exterior of the assembled tubes (top_handle_3_R1,TGAGTTCTATGCCAGATACTACGGCTACACTAGAAG TCCTCCTCCTCCTCCTCCT).
* The positions of the used ssDNA overhangs are annotated in the scadnano file.
