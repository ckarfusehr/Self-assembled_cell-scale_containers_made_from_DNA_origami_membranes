## Notes: OxDNA

OxDNA simulations were conducted for the purpose of structure visualization. In this folder, we provide Oxview files of the following systems:

* A monomer without the ssDNA scaffold extending beyond the origami, after manual positioning of the monomer's walls, but prior to any relaxation.
* A relaxed monomer, including the complete ssDNA scaffold. This folder also contains all the relaxation and simulation input files used, as well as the Python code utilized.
