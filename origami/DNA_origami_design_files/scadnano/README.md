##  Notes: scadnano

* The provided scadnano file contains the DNA origami design used in this work. 
* Special staples are identified within the scadnano file, corresponding to their names in the sequence files.
* A cadnano file of the original structure by Wickham et al. is available in the Supplementary Information of the original article.
* It should be noted that in this study, we used a linear 2873-base scaffold, in contrast to the more commonly used p7308 scaffold in the original design.
