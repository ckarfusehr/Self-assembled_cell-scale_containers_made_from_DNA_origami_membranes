Authors: Christoph Karfusehr, Markus Eder, Friedrich C. Simmel

This repository contains:

* Code used to generate DNA staple sequences for curved assemblies.
* Code enabling the extraction of sequences for assemblies with radii closest to the desired values.
* Raw tube and vesicle diameter data, extracted from TEM images.
* All DNA sequences, design files (scadnano), and OxDNA simulation files utilized in this study.
* Code and data used for the Moir√© pattern analysis.
* Code and data used to estimate the number of monomers and the Mw of large container.
